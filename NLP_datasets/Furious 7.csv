Eric Eisenberg,CinemaBlend,"The most over-the-top sequences the filmmakers could imagine, and each one is as fun as the last.",|,"Mar 16, 2015"
Scott Weinberg,Nerdist,"The filmmakers are well aware of how silly this franchise has become. They're more than happy to keep the good times rolling, just so long as they can keep finding new and amusing ways in which to drive cars irresponsibly and destroy buildings at will.","| Original Score: 4.5/5

Dominick Suzanne-Mayer,Consequence,"As a relentlessly paced action movie, Furious 7 is an excellent entry for those who would appreciate this sort of thing. As a memorial for one of its own, it's about as affecting as big, loud, ridiculous action movies get.","| Original Score: B+
