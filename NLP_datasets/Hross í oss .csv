Dennis Harvey,48 Hills,"A bracing, darkly funny series of interlocking tales in which equine behavior came off considerably better than that of humans...",|,"Oct 28, 2020"
Patrick Gamble,CineVue,"A laconic, lyrical script is peppered with subtle moments of absurdity to paint a twisted portrait of the director's homeland. Set against the picturesque, ashen vistas of the Icelandic landscape, Erlingsson constructs a dense and multifaceted drama.","| Original Score: 4/5

Forrest Cardamenis,The Film Stage,"Of Horses and Men is nothing if not memorable, and it matches its missteps with commendable and thoughtful formal and stylistic prowess.","| Original Score: B-

Alan Scherstuhl,Village Voice,"Of Horses and Men is the rare honest film about horses, one as frank about their tubelike erections as it is caught up in the beauty of gaits and forelocks and that profusion of lashes over those moistly delicate eyes.",|,"Mar 10, 2015"
Margot Harrison,Seven Days (VT),"Think of this as a western of the far north - one with no bad guys, a few stunts and showdowns, and horses who share top billing with their riders.","| Original Score: 8/10
